### Hi there, I'm Ethan Harvey
I'm a Ph.D. Student at the [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/) [Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab](https://www.hci.cs.tufts.edu/) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/), advised by [Dr. Rob Jacob](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/). I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics minor from [Grove City College](https://www.gcc.edu/), where I worked with [Dr. Jonathan Hutchins](https://www.gcc.edu/Home/Academics/Faculty-Directory/Faculty-Detail/jonathan-o-hutchins) on acoustic gait analysis using unsupervised learning.
