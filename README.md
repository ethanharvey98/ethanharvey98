### Hi there, I'm Ethan Harvey
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/) at [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/), advised by [Dr. Rob Jacob](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/). I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics minor from [Grove City College](https://www.gcc.edu/). I'm interested in researching mobile sensing systems, including applications on iOS, Android, and Web platforms; ubiquitous computing, mobile sensing applied machine learning, and mobile health; and the application of machine learning on acoustic signals as a surrogate for quantitative measurements.
